# Project Title: <b> Design and Implementation to Secure the Network Model for Batsol </B>

The purpose of the project "Design and Implementation for Batsol Company" is to provide a 
scalable, secure, and effective network model for the business. The network must provide 
smooth communication between these sites through remote connections as Batsol, which has its 
main branch in Batticaloa, migrates to two new branches in Kandy and Colombo. The main goal 
is to create a strong network architecture that guarantees safe data transmission, communication, 
and accessibility between the branches. The project follows a methodical process, analyzing the 
needs of the business, creating a thorough network architecture, putting security measures in 
place, and installing cloud-based solutions

To increase security, the network architecture has cloud-based firewalls, Virtual Private Network 
(VPN) technology offers encrypted and authenticated remote access for authorised users, and 
VLAN configurations meet various departmental demands. To make future maintenance, 
troubleshooting, and information sharing easier, the project places an emphasis on extensive 
documentation, including network diagrams, IP address allocations, and device installations. The 
effectiveness and durability of the network are ensured by thorough testing and validation. The 
project's ultimate goal is to effortlessly hand over the network model to the operations team, 
along with the support and training that are required. Batsol is in a position to provide safe and 
effective communication between its branches thanks to a well-designed and managed network, 
facilitating expansion and success in the new sites.
